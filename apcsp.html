    <p>I picked this AP class because of my interest in computers. I took an interest in computer science because I wanted to see how compicated it is to code or make a website, and how to learn to make a game or website myself by coding. I use computers everyday to game and do homework so it seemed like a no brainer for me to pick a computer class.
